                <h2><br><br> ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p><br>Aurimas Alkevicius is an ambassador of life, with experience in learning various academic subjects in semester-long courses. His background in academics, athletics, and the corporate environment displays his mindful but approachable
                    competitiveness. Aurimas is driven by his passion for understanding the intricacies of cross-cultural project development collaborations.
                    <br><br> He considers himself a lifetime student, eager to both build on his deep academic foundations in computer science and mathematics. He stays in tune with the latest partnerships, digital advancements through continued coursework.
                    His enthusiasm for learning and understanding to turn information into action has contributed to his most recent success at the <a href="https://www.uml.edu/" title="University of Massachusetts page." target=_blank>University of Massachusetts</a>.
                    He attended award-winning courses on-campus and online for critical subjects, such as Discrete Structures II, Linear Algebra I, and Computing Theory. Meanwhile, he vastly improved his understanding of subjects by implementing strategic
                    course assignment completion methods and ensuring an adequate work-life balance.
                    <br><br>Aurimas believes mindfulness in daily life is key to success - a tenet he lives out through his interests in reflection, horticulture, and woodworking. Aurimas is currently attending university as a freelance student and is
                    always interested in a challenge.</p>
